# AlphaSolid

- 😀 Hello ~~World~~ There! I joined GitHub recently, because I am bored...

- 👀 I'm interested in coding ever since 7 years old.

- 🧐 I am currently learning Backend Programming Languages (Java, Python, etc)

- 🐧 I’m looking to collaborate on a **sus** project

- 📫 How to reach me? There's no need to do that, bye
